# Hello!
I'm Sarah Dowling. I'm currently doing [Generation Australia's Junior Web Developer program](https://australia.generation.org/programs/become-a-web-developer/) to make a career change into doing something I've loved as a hobby for 22 years(!).

# Currently...
* Making progress through [Codecademy's Learn Git & GitHub course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git)
* ~~Working through [GitHub Skills](https://skills.github.com/) courses. My next course to start will be [Review pull requests](https://github.com/skills/review-pull-requests).~~ Put on hold to work on the above, will revisit what I learn next on GitHub Skills when complete
* Working through (very slowly) [Codecademy's Computer Science Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/computer-science) when I'm caught up with work on my program
* Coding my own theme for [Grav](https://getgrav.org/) in my spare time. While I'm not ready to create the repo here on GitHub just yet, some of the work I've been doing towards it can be found on [my fork of the Grav plugin Social Media Links](https://github.com/sarahloui-se/social-media-links) by [Torsten Sauer](https://github.com/torsten-sauer), [this mobile friendly gradient](https://github.com/sarahloui-se/mobile-friendly-gradient) and [responsive-flexbox-nav](https://github.com/sarahloui-se/responsive-flexbox-nav)

# When I'm not coding...
I can be found reacquainting myself for my love of making music - I'm currently learning to DJ, and rekindling my love for music production in the process :)
