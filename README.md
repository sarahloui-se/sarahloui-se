### Hello!
I'm Sarah Dowling. In my spare time, I'm here induldging my 20+ year hobby of coding (predominantly HTML & CSS); but I'm actually a freelance marketing & events professional.

### Currently...
I'm working through [GitHub Skills](https://skills.github.com/) courses. My next course to start will be [Review pull requests](https://github.com/skills/review-pull-requests).
I'm also working through [Codecademy's Learn How to Code course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-how-to-code) - I'm about to start the [Data Types lesson](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-how-to-code/lessons/bop-datatypes/exercises/datatypes).
