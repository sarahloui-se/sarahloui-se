# Hello!
I'm Sarah Dowling. I'm currently teaching myself front end web development to make a career change into doing something I've loved as a hobby for 22 years(!).

# Currently...
* Working through [GitHub Skills](https://skills.github.com/) courses. My next course to start will be [Hello GitHub Actions](https://github.com/skills/hello-github-actions)
* Coding my own theme for [Grav](https://getgrav.org/) in my spare time. While I'm not ready to create the repo here on GitHub just yet, some of the work I've been doing towards it can be found on [my fork of the Grav plugin Social Media Links](https://github.com/sarahloui-se/social-media-links) by [Torsten Sauer](https://github.com/torsten-sauer), [this mobile friendly gradient](https://github.com/sarahloui-se/mobile-friendly-gradient) and [responsive-flexbox-nav](https://github.com/sarahloui-se/responsive-flexbox-nav)

# When I'm not coding...
I can be found reacquainting myself for my love of making music - I'm currently learning to DJ, and rekindling my love for music production in the process :)
